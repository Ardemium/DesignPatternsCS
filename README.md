# DesignPaterns📘

## About 📖

Welcome to the **DesignPaterns** repository! Here, we dive deep into the world of design patterns, focusing specifically on their implementation in C#.

## Repository Structure 📂

Every design pattern covered here follows a consistent folder structure for ease of navigation:

- **README**: Grasp the essence and the problem a pattern aims to solve.
- **UML**: Visualize the design pattern's structure.
- **src**: Witness the pattern in action through C# code.
- **tests**: Assure correctness with unit tests for each implementation.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ardemium/DesignPaterns.git
```

2. Navigate to a design pattern of your choice and explore its contents.
3. Each pattern's folder will contain runnable C# `srs` & `tests` examples. Ensure you have dotnet to test and run C# programs.

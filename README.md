## About 📖

Welcome to the **DesignPaterns** repository! Here, we dive deep into the world of design patterns, focusing specifically on their implementation in C#.

## What are Design Patterns?

Design Patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They represent best practices and are categorized into creational, structural, and behavioral patterns.

## Why use Design Patterns?

Using design patterns in software development has several advantages:

1. **Reusability**: Patterns provide tried and tested solutions, which can be reused to solve recurring design problems.
2. **Understandability**: Patterns provide a common vocabulary for developers, making it easier to communicate complex designs.
3. **Maintainability**: Patterns promote modularity and flexibility in the code, making it easier to refactor or scale.
4. **Efficiency**: Leveraging patterns can reduce development time as they provide templates for solving common problems.

## Repository Structure 📂

Every design pattern covered here follows a consistent folder structure for ease of navigation:

- **README**: Grasp the essence and the problem a pattern aims to solve.
- **UML**: Visualize the design pattern's structure.
- **src**: Witness the pattern in action through C# code.
- **tests**: Assure correctness with unit tests for each implementation.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ardemium/DesignPaterns.git
```

2. Navigate to a design pattern of your choice and explore its contents.
3. Each pattern's folder will contain runnable C# `srs` & `tests` examples. Ensure you have dotnet to test and run C# programs.

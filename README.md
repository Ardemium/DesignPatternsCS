# DesignPaterns Repository 📘

## About 📖

Welcome to the **DesignPaterns** repository! Here, we dive deep into the world of design patterns, focusing specifically on their implementation in C#. What sets this repository apart is our unique "School" context approach, aiming to provide a real-world touch to these often abstract concepts.

## Why the "School" Context? 🏫

Every design pattern in this repository is explained and demonstrated using examples rooted in the world of education and schooling. This context is chosen to make abstract patterns feel familiar and to provide relatable scenarios for developers at all levels.

## Repository Structure 📂

Every design pattern covered here follows a consistent folder structure for ease of navigation:

- **ConceptualOverview**: Grasp the essence and the problem a pattern aims to solve.
- **UMLDiagram**: Visualize the design pattern's structure.
- **Implementation**: Witness the pattern in action through C# code, detailed with `BaseImplementation` and richer `DetailedExamples`.
- **Explanation**: Delve into the intricacies, roles, and interactions within the pattern.
- **UseCases**: Experience the practicality of patterns through school-themed scenarios.
- **Tests**: Assure correctness with unit tests for each implementation.
- **AdditionalResources**: Venture beyond with handpicked articles, videos, and other resources.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Ardemium/DesignPaterns.git
```

2. Navigate to a design pattern of your choice and explore its contents.
3. Each pattern's `Implementation` folder will contain runnable C# examples. Ensure you have the necessary environment set up to run C# programs.

# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, promoting flexibility and efficiency in the object instantiation process.

## Patterns Covered:

1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

## Overview:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class only has one instance and provides a global point to access it.
- **Factory Method**: Provides an interface for creating instances of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype**: Creates objects based on a template of an existing object through cloning.

# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They leverage inheritance and interfaces to compose interfaces or define ways to compose objects for new functionality.

## Patterns Covered:

1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

## Overview:

- **Adapter**: Matches interfaces of different classes, making them compatible.
- **Bridge**: Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, so both can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Allows individual objects and compositions of objects to be treated uniformly.
- **Decorator**: Allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, making it easier to access.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

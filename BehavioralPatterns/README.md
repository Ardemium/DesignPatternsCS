# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns involve the responsibilities and collaboration between objects, ensuring that objects play well together.

## Patterns Covered:

1. Observer
2. Strategy
3. Command
4. Iterator
5. Mediator
6. Memento
7. State
8. Template Method
9. Visitor
10. Chain of Responsibility
11. Interpreter

## Overview:

- **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- **Strategy**: Allows selecting an algorithm's implementation at runtime.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing users to parameterize clients with different requests.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Centralizes complex communications and control between related objects, decoupling them from each other.
- **Memento**: Allows for the ability to restore an object to its previous state, providing an undo functionality.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method**: Provides a skeleton of an algorithm in an algorithm class but delays some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Decouples request sender and receiver by letting multiple objects handle the request.
- **Interpreter**: Provides a way to evaluate sentences or expressions for particular languages.
